The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems  
Forgiven I'm alive, restored set free  
Your Majesty resides inside of me  
Forever I believe, forever I believe

Arrested by your truth and righteousness  
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness  
Convicted by your spirit, led by your word  
Your love will never fail, your love will never fail

'Cause I know you gave the world  
Your only son for us  
To know your name  
To live within the saviour's love and He took my place  
Knowing He'd be crucified  
And You loved, You loved  
A people undeserving!
