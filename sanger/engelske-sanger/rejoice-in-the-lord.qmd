O ey o ey o :/

Rejoice in the Lord  
and again I say rejoice :/

Your kindness a bounce  
to the ends of the earth.  
Your grace and your mercyÂ  surrounds us oh Lord  
Your name is exalted  
for you are Lord of all (Come to the river)

Come to the river  
and drink from the water of life. :/

There's healing, deliverance,  
salvation and more  
The river is poured out for one and for all  
So, come to the river  
and drink from the water of life. :/

You're a mighty God,  
You're an awesome God,  
You're a healing God,  
You're a sovereign God,

O ey o ey o  
Rejoice in the Lord :/
