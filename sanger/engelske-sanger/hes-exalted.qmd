He is exalted the King is exalted on High  
I will praise You  
He is exalted forever exalted  
And I will praise His name

**Chorus**  
He is the Lord  
Forever His truth shall reign  
Heaven and Earth  
Rejoice in His holy name  
He is exalted the King is exalted on high

He is exalted the King is exalted on High  
I will praise Him  
He is exalted forever exalted  
And I will praise His name
