There is none like You  
No one else can touch my heart like You do  
And I can search for all eternity, Lord  
And find, there is none like You

There is none like You  
No one else can touch my heart like You do  
And I can search for all eternity, Lord  
And find, there is none like You

Your mercy flows like a river so wide  
And healing comes from Your hand  
Suffering children are safe in Your arms  
There is none like You

There is none like You  
No one else can touch my heart like You do  
And I can search for all eternity, Lord  
And find, there is none like You  
Oh I can search for all eternity, Lord  
And find, there is none (there is none)  
There is none (there is none)  
There is none like You

There is none like You
