Jesus was the name  
of a special man  
Nothing´s been the same  
since I became his fan

**Chorus:**  
  |  |: He´s got the whole universe  
under his command  
follow that man, follow that man! :  |  |

He went down to the sea  
some fishermen were there  
He asked them; "Come with me!"  
They joined him everywhere

**Chorus:**  
  |  |: He´s got the whole universe  
under his command  
follow that man, follow that man! :  |  |

He showed them what is right,  
and taught them what is true,  
was God in all his might,  
and man like me and you

**Chorus:**  
  |  |: He´s got the whole universe  
under his command  
follow that man, follow that man! :  |  |

He paid an awful price,  
they nailed him to a cross  
Now he´s in paradise,  
waiting there for us

**Chorus:**  
  |  |: He´s got the whole universe  
under his command  
follow that man, follow that man! :  |  |
