VERSE 1:  
Here I am  
Down on my knees again  
Surrendering all  
Surrendering all

VERSE 2:  
Find me here  
Lord as You draw me near  
Desperate for You  
Desperate for You  
I surrender

VERSE 3:  
Drench my soul  
As mercy and grace unfold  
I hunger and thirst  
I hunger and thirst

VERSE 4:  
With arms stretched wide  
I know You hear my cry  
Speak to me now  
Speak to me now

CHORUS:  
I surrender  
I surrender  
I want to know You more  
I want to know You more

BRIDGE:  
Like a rushing wind Jesus breathe within  
Lord have Your way  
Lord have Your way in me

Like a mighty storm  
Stir within my soul  
Lord have Your way  
Lord have Your way in me
