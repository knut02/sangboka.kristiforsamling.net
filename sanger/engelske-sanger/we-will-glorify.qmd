We will glorify the King of Kings  
We will glorify the Lamb  
We will glorify the Lord of Lords  
Who is the great I Am

Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty  
We will bow before His throne  
We will worship Him in righteousness  
We will worship Him alone

He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth  
He is Lord of all who live  
He is Lord of all the universe  
All praise to Him we give

Hallelujah to the King of Kings  
Hallelujah to the Lamb  
Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords  
Who is the great I Am
