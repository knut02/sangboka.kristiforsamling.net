Have you met the doctor of my heart?  
He made it restart  
He's the benefactor of my soul  
He makes me whole

**Choir:**  
We are friends  
and he shows me a love so tender, yet intense  
It was love that made him die on a cross  
He gave up everything for us

Have you met my teacher?  
Wisdom flows wherever he goes  
Once he was a preacher  
He told what's required before he retired

**Choir:**  
We are friends  
and he shows me a love so tender, yet intense  
It was love that made him die on a cross  
He gave up everything for us

Have you met the master of my house?  
It's not my spouse!  
Let's approach him faster  
When you meet, he'll wash your feet

**Choir:**  
We are friends  
and he shows me a love so tender, yet intense  
It was love that made him die on a cross  
He gave up everything for us
