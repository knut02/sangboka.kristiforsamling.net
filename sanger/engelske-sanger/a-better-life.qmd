One hope, one love, one faith, one life

 You will see a light shine in the darkness  
Bringing hope to people in despair  
with a love that gets through every defence  
He will reign His kingdom  
and rejoice over all his children]{.verse} 

One hope that lasts forever,  
one love that never fails  
One faith that he ´s the Savior  
Giving life and never ending grace  
(x2)

When your life ´s a pain and you must suffer  
And you may be tempted to give in  
Just remember him who walks before you  
You ´ll be tied together even closer,  
so reach for heaven

One hope that lasts forever,  
one love that never fails  
One faith that he ´s the Savior  
Giving life and never ending grace  
(x2)

One hope, one love, one faith, one life
