Lord come and heal Your Church  
Take our lives and cleanse with Your fire  
Let Your deliverance flow  
As we lift Your name up higher

We will draw near  
And surrender our fear  
Lift our hands to proclaim  
Holy Father You are here

Spirit of God come in  
And release our hearts to praise You  
Make us whole for  
Holy we'll become And serve You

Show us Your power we pray  
That we might share In your glory  
We shall arise and go  
To proclaim Your works most holy
