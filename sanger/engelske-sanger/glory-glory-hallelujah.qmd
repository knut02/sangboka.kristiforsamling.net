Glory, glory, hallelujah  
since I lay my burdens down (way on down)  
Glory, glory, hallelujah  
since I lay my burdens down (way on down)

I don't walk the walk that I used to...

I don't talk the talk that I used to...

I don't treat my friends like I used to...

Friends don't treat me like they used to...

I sing new songs for my Father...

I'm so happy, oh, so happy
