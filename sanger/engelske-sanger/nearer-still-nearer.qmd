Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,  
Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;  
Fold me, oh, fold me close to Thy breast,  
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest,":/ 

Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,  
Naught as an offering to Jesus, my King;  
Only my sinful, now contrite heart,  
Grant me the cleansing  
Thy blood doth impart,:/ 

Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine!  
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,  
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride,  
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified,:/ 

Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,  
'Til safe in glory my anchor is cast;  
Through endless ages, ever to be,  
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,:/
