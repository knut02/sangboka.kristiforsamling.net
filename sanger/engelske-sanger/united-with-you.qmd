Jesus, my brother  
You're so different from any other  
person I know  
By your shoulder  
I get wiser and I get bolder  
You make me grow

Help me talk like you did  
Help me walk like you did  
Jesus, I long to be united with you

Jesus, refine me  
I will let your words define me,  
be my guide!  
You give me vision,  
I'm a part of the ultimate mission  
by your side

Help me share like you did  
Help me dare like you did  
Jesus, I long to be united with you

Jesus, I praise you  
One day soon I will embrace you,  
see your face  
Where I am living,  
I will imitate your loving and giving,  
by your grace

Help me give like you did  
Help me live like you did  
Jesus, I long to be united with you x2
