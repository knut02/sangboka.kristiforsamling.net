**Chorus**  
Hosanna  
Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest (x2)

I see the King of glory  
Coming on the clouds with fire  
The whole earth shakes  
The whole earth shakes

I see His love and mercy  
Washing over all our sin  
The people sing  
The people sing

**Chorus**  
Hosanna  
Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest (x2)

I see a generation  
Rising up to take their place  
With selfless faith  
With selfless faith

I see a near revival  
Stirring as we pray and seek  
We're on our knees  
We're on our knees

**Chorus**  
Hosanna  
Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest (x2)

Heal my heart and make it clean  
Open up my eyes to the things unseen  
Show me how to love like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks Yours  
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause  
As I walk from nothing, to eternity

**Chorus**  
Hosanna  
Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest (x2)  

Hosanna in the highest
