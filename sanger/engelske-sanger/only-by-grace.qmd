Only by grace can we enter  
Only by grace can we stand  
Not by our human endeavour  
But by the blood of the Lamb

Into Your presence You call us  
You call us to come  
Into Your presence You draw us  
And now by Your grace we come  
Now by Your grace we come

Lord, if You marked our transgressions  
Who would stand  
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed  
by the blood of the Lamb

Lord, if You marked our transgressions  
Who would stand  
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed  
by the blood of the Lamb
