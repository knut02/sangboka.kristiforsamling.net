Lord, we sing your praises loud,  
Sing them to the stumbling crowd,  
Sing of Jesus and His word,  
Sing until the earth has heard.

**Chorus :**  
Hallelujah :/ 

Sing of crosses and His blood,  
Earthquakes, darkness and the flood.  
Sing of judgment, sing of grace,  
Sing until we see His face.

**Chorus :**  
Hallelujah :/ 

God is why we live and sing,  
We the servants, He the king.  
All His power, all His life,  
Living in the church, His wife.

**Chorus :**  
Hallelujah :/ 

God is justice, God is love.  
God is reigning from above.  
God is sovereign o'er the land.  
Nations bow at His command.

**Chorus :**  
Hallelujah :/ 

Life is but a passing glance,  
Seek Him while you have the chance.  
We are made of naught but clay,  
Til we're changed on that great day.

**Chorus :**  
Hallelujah :/
