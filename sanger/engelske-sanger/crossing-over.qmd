We're crossing over one by one;  
We're moving on to the setting sun.  
Don't let Him catch you with your work undone.  
We're crossing over one by one.

Go, share your faith one by one;  
We're moving on to the setting sun.  
Don't let Him catch you with your work undone.  
We're crossing over one by one.

Go, make disciples one by one;  
We're moving on to the setting sun.  
Don't let Him catch you with your work undone.  
We're crossing over one by one.
