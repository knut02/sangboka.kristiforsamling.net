I'm gonna view that holy city  
Oh I'm gonna view that holy city one of these days  
I'm gonna view that holy city  
I'm gonna view that holy city one of these days

I'm gonna see my loving Jesus ...

I'm gonna sit at the welcome table ...

I'm gonna feast on milk and honey ...

I'm gonna sing and never get tired ...

I'm gonna make my home in heaven ...

I'm gonna meet with Paul and Peter ...

I'm gonna praise my precious Saviour ...
