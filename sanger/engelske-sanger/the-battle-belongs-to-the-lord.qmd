In heavenly armor we'll enter the land,  
The battle belongs to the Lord.  
No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand,  
The battle belongs to the Lord.

**Chorus :**  
We're singing glory, honor.  
Power and strength to the Lord :/ 

When the power of darkness comes in like a flood,  
The battle belongs to the Lord.  
He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood,  
The battle belongs to the Lord.

**Chorus :**  
We're singing glory, honor.  
Power and strength to the Lord :/ 

When your enemy presses in hard do not fear,  
The battle belongs to the Lord.  
Take courage, my friend, your redemption is near,  
The battle belongs to the Lord.

**Chorus :**  
We're singing glory, honor.  
Power and strength to the Lord :/
