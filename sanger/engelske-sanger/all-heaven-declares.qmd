All heav'n declares the glory of the risen Lord  
Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord

**Chorus**  
Forever he will be, the Lamb upon the throne  
I gladly bow the knee and worship him alone

I will proclaime the glory of the risen Lord  
Who once was slain, to reconcile man to God

**Chorus**  
Forever he will be, the Lamb upon the throne  
I gladly bow the knee and worship him alone
