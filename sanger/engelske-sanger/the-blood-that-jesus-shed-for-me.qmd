The blood that Jesus shed for me  
way back on Calvary  
the blood that gives me strength  
from day to day  
it will never lose its pow'r

It reaches to the highest mountain  
It flows to the lowest valley  
The blood that gives me strength  
from day to day  
it will never lose its pow'r

It soothes my doubt and calms my fears  
and it dries all my tears  
the blood that gives me strength  
from day to day  
it will never lose its pow'r

It reaches to the highest mountain  
It flows to the lowest valley  
The blood that gives me strength  
from day to day  
it will never lose its pow'r
