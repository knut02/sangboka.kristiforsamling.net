Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,  
that saved a wretch like me.  
I once was lost, but now I'm found,  
was blind but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,  
and grace my fears relieved.  
How precious did that grace appear,  
the hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,  
I have already come.  
This grace has brought me safe this far,  
and grace will lead me home.

When we've been there ten thousand years,  
bright shining as the sun,  
we've no less days, to sing God's praise,  
than when we first begun.
