O Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary,  
pure and holy, tried and true.  
With thanksgiving I'll be a living,  
sanctuary for you.

It was you lord who gave the savior,  
heart and soul Lord, for every man.  
It is you lord, who knows my weakness,  
you refine me with thine own hand.

Lead me o Lord through temptation,  
you refine me from within.  
Fill our hearts with your holy spirit,  
and take all our sins away.
