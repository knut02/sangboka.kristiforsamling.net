Holy words long preserved  
for our walk in this world,  
they resound with God's own heart  
Oh, let the ancient words impart

Words of life, words of hope,  
give us strength, help us cope  
In this world where'er we roam,  
ancient words will guide us home

Chorus:  
Ancient words, ever true,  
changing me and changing you  
We have come with open hearts  
O, let the ancient words impart

Holy words of our faith  
handed down to this age,  
came to us through sacrifice  
O, heed the faithful words of Christ

Holy words long preserved  
for our walk in this world,  
they resound with God's own heart  
Oh, let the ancient words impart

Chorus:  
Ancient words, ever true,  
changing me and changing you  
We have come with open hearts  
Oh, let the ancient words impart
