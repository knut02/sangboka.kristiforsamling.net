Hide me now,  
Under Your wings  
Cover me,  
With in Your mighty hand

When the oceans rise  
and thunders roar  
I will soar with You,  
a bove the storm

Father, You are King  
over the flood  
I will be still and know  
You are God

Find rest my soul  
In Christ a lone  
Know His power  
In quietness and trust
