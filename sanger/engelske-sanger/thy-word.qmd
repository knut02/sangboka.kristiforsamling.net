**Chorus:**  
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet  
And a light unto my path.  
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet  
And a light unto my path.

When I feel afraid,  
And think I've lost my way.  
Still, You're there right beside me.  
Nothing will I fear  
As long as You are near;  
Please be near me to the end.

I will not forget  
Your love for me and yet,  
My heart forever is wandering.  
Jesus be my guide,  
And hold me to Your side,  
And I will love you to the end.

Nothing will I fear  
As long as You are near;  
Please be near me to the end.

Thy word is a lamp unto my feet  
And a light unto my path.  
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet  
And a light unto my path.  
And a light unto my path.  
You're the light unto my path.
