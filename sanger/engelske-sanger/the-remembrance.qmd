This bread it is my body  
a sacrifice for you  
All your sins I carry  
believe, for it is true

**Choir:**  
Eat it, drink it to remember  
that I love you thoroughly  
A love for every single member  
of my holy family

This cup contains my own blood  
a convenant brand new  
An off-ring pleasing my God  
is poured out for you

**Choir:**  
Eat it, drink it to remember  
that I love you thoroughly  
A love for every single member  
of my holy family

This meal is what i longed for  
to take with you, my dear  
But I will have it no more  
until I'll see you there

**Choir:**  
Eat it, drink it to remember  
that I love you thoroughly  
A love for every single member  
of my holy family
