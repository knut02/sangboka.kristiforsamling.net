Joshua fit the battle of Jericho,  
Jericho, Jericho  
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho  
And the walls come tumbling down

You can talk about your man of Gideon  
You can talk about your king of Saul  
But theres none like good old Joshua  
who fit the battle of Jericho

Up to the walls of Jericho  
They marched with spear in hand  
Go blow the ram horns, Joshua cried  
' Cause the battle is in my hand

Then the lam-ram sheep-horns begin to blow  
The trupets begin to sound  
Old Joshua commanded the Children to shout  
And the walls come tumbling down
