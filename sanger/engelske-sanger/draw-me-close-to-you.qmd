Draw me close to You  
Never let me go  
I lay it all down again  
To hear You say that I'm Your friend

You are my desire  
No one else will do  
'Cause nothing else could take Your place  
To feel the warmth of Your embrace  

Help me find the way  
Bring me back to You

**Chorus:**  
You're all I want  
You're all I've ever needed  
You're all I want  
Help me know You are near

(repeat from the top)

**Chorus:**  
You're all I want  
You're all I've ever needed  
You're all I want  
Help me know You are near
