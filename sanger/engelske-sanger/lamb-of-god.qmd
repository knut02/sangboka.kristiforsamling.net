Your only Son  
No sin to hide  
But You have sent Him,  
From Your side  
To walk upon this guilty sod  
And to become the Lamb of God

Your gift of Love  
They crucified  
They laughed and scorned him as he died  
The humble King  
They named a fraud  
And sacrificed the Lamb of God

**Chorus:**  
Oh Lamb of God, Sweet lamb of God  
I love the Holy Lamb of God  
Oh wash me in His precious Blood  
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

I was so lost I should have died  
But You have brought me to Your side  
To be led by Your staff and rod  
And to be call a lamb of God

**Chorus:**  
Oh Lamb of God, Sweet lamb of God  
I love the Holy Lamb of God  
Oh wash me in His precious Blood  
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

Oh wash me in His precious Blood  
My Jesus Chris the Lamb of God
