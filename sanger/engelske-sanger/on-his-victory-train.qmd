Jesus Christ is my brother,  
is my Saviour, He's with the Father  
Waitin' there, in the heavens  
We're on His victory train, right now (x2)

He's full of grace, full of truth  
oh, what's the matter? It's win or loose!  
Let Him lead you, to the waters  
We're on His victory train, right now (x2)

So, fill the waters and get under  
Let us praise Him, 'cause it's a wonder  
Listen to Him, to Messiah  
We're on His victory train, right now (x2)

Come on over, to His Kingdom  
Where the love is, and where the light is  
To your brothers and your sisters  
We're on His victory train, right now (x2)
