Give me water never drying, I am asking you  
Many times I have been trying  
but never coming through  
If You give me living water will I be fulfilled?  
Can my life get back to order  
and my soul be still?

Promises that lift my mind, you are telling me  
Everything I ever longed for, you want me to see

**Chorus :**  
Give me life that never ends,  
let me live forever  
Eternal life is in Your hands,  
let me drink that water  
Give me life that never ends  
where you'll go I follow  
Eternal life is in your hands  
longing for tomorrow -- with You
