O To you, O Lord, I lift my soul  
You're my Saviour, you're the one I trust  
Show me your ways, O Lord my God  
Teach me how to follow in your paths  
Remember, O Lord, your mercy and your love from old

O My eyes are ever on the Lord  
He who knows my weakness and my faults  
Lord, guard my life and rescue me  
Let my enemies be put to shame  
For I take refuge in you and you deliever me

O Be merciful to me, O Lord  
Take away all my iniquity  
Lord, turn to me and hear my voice  
Look upon the sorrow in my heart  
The Lord is my strength, my soul finds rest in God alone
