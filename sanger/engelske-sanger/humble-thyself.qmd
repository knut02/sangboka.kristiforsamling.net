Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord :/  
And he will lift you up:/

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost but now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see

When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun

We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we first begun

Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord  
And he will lift you up
