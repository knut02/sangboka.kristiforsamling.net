Be still my soul, the Lord is on thy side;  
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.  
Leave to thy God to order and provide;  
In ev'ry change, He faithful will remain.  
Be still my soul, thy best, thy heavenly friend  
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul
When dearest friends depart
And all is darkened in the vale of tears
Then shalt thou better know His Love, His heart
Who comes to soothe thy sorrows and thy fears

Be still my soul, the hour hastening on  
When we shall be forever with the Lord.  
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone;  
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joy restored.  
Be still my soul, when change and tears are past,  
All safe and blessed, we shall meet at last.
