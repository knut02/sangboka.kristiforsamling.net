We need you now  
We need your fire within  
We need your love  
We need you as our friend  
We need your light  
To guide through what's ahead  
We need you now  
We need you now

**Chorus:**  
The Spirit's fire  
Almighty flame  
Calling us higher  
Never the same  
Burn in our hearts  
Flow through our veins  
The Spirit's fire  
The Spirit's fire

Chorus (men):  
Holy spirit mighty flame  
Call us higher never the same  
In our hearts flow through our veins  
Holy Spirit's fire

Your power made  
This universe we see  
Your power saved  
Our lives and set us free  
Your power's here  
Among us as we sing  
You're everything  
You're everything

Give us your fire  
To carry us along  
Give us desire  
To build the kingdom strong  
Give us the dream  
And when the dream is done  
We'll be with you  
We'll be with you
