There is no shadow of turning in You,  
no rebellion or pride  
You don't know greed or envy or strife;  
Your intentions are pure and holy

Delighting to do the Father's will,  
You don't have a thought against Him  
But humbly You live in perfect restraint,  
waiting for promises given

Jesus, You have a beautiful heart  
(x2)

You're gentle, You're meek,  
yet Your heart is strong  
Jesus, Your gladness is contagious  
You are not selfish, You can't compromise;  
You are the truth, You can't lie

You don't hold a grudge or have a cynical eye;  
bitterness has no part of You  
But You're quick to forgive,  
let me back in again;  
Your kindness is so liberating

Jesus, You have a beautiful heart  
(x2)
