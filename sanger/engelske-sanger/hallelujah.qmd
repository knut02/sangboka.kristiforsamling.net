Hallelujah, my Father  
For giving us your Son  
Sending Him into the world  
To be given up for men  
Knowing we would bruise Him  
And smite Him from the earth

Hallelujah, my Father  
In His death is my birth  
Hallelujah, my Father  
In his life is my life

Hallelujah, my Jesus,  
for dying on a tree  
Through sad tears you´re looking down,  
And I know that you see me  
Trying to live my way  
And not the way you would

Hallelujah, my Jesus  
In Your death is my birth  
Hallelujah, my Jesus  
In your life is my life  
Hallelujah, Great Spirit  
for living in my heart

I know now that Your word is true  
From You I will not depart  
Sift me, and convict me  
I´ll teach You to the world

Hallelujah, my Father  
In His death is my birth  
Hallelujah, my Father  
In His life is my life
