Silence now, let the shades be gone  
calm your soul in my smiling dawn.  
Hear my call; though you may be astray  
I won't be far away  
I was there long before your start  
know the cause of your broken heart  
Lean on me and let me fill your need  
embrace your soul, and lead

Don't believe in a life in vain  
I will free you from guilt and chain  
Hear my word! You'll find the truth in me  
and truth will set you free  
Dress up now in a joyful way  
All your sins have been washed away  
I'll renew your song with joy and grace  
and shine out through your face.

Keep in mind that I rose you up  
from the dust you will reach the top  
Rise and shine, for you have grown to light  
for those who walk by night  
Share the bread that I gave to you  
quench their thirst with eternal brew  
Show the world that children from above  
are all combined in love.
