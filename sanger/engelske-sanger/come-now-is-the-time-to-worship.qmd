Come, now is the time to worship  
Come, now is the time to give your heart  
Come, just as you are to worship  
Come, just as you are before your God.  
Come

One day every tongue will confess you are God  
One day every knee will bow  
Still the greatest treasure remains for  
those  who gladly choose you now

Come, now is the time to worship  
Come, now is the time to give your heart  
Come, just as you are to worship  
Come, just as you are before your God.  
Come

One day every tongue will confess you are God  
One day every knee will bow  
Still the greatest treasure remains for  
those  who gladly choose you now
(X2)

Come, now is the time to worship  
Come, now is the time to give your heart  
Oh Come, just as you are to worship  
Come, just as you are before your God.  
Come
