When You found me  
My whole world changed  
I'm redeemed by Your life

Let the earth see  
You are freedom  
Turned my darkness to light

**Bridge:**  
You welcomed me in with open arms  
Into unending life

**Chorus:**  
I'm not ashamed of the gospel Lord  
Your power, Your love that saved my soul  
Now I'm alive in You  
I live in the risen Son
