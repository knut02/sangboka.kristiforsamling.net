Men: I will call upon the Lord (Women repeat)  
Men: Who is worthy to be praised  
Men: So shall I be saved from my enemies

**Chorus :**  
The Lord liveth, and blessed be the Rock  
And let the God of my salvation be exalted :/ 

Men: Jesus Christ He died for me  
Men: And He took away my sin  
Men: I will live with Him for eternity
