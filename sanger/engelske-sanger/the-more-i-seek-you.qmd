The more I seek you,  
The more I find you  
The more I find you,  
the more I love you

I wanna sit at your feet  
Drink from the cup in your hand.  
Lay back against you and breath,  
feel your heart beat  
This love is so deep,  
it's more than I can stand.  
I melt in your peace,  
it's overwhelming
