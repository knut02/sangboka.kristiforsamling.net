Jesus, i've forgotten the words that You have spoken;  
promises that burned within my heart has now grown dim  
With a doubting heart i follow the paths of eartly wisdom  
Forgive me for my unbelief, renew the fire again

**Choir:**  
Lord, have mercy  
Christ, have mercy  
Lord, have mercy on me  
(x2)

I have built an altar where i worship things of man  
I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from You  
Now i am returning to Your mercies ever flowing  
Pardon my transgressions; help me love You again

**Choir:**  
Lord, have mercy  
Christ, have mercy  
Lord, have mercy on me  
(x2)  
I have longed to know You and Your tender mercies,  
like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end  
I bow my heart before You in the goodness of Your presence,  
Your grace forever shining like a beacon in the night

**Choir:**  
Lord, have mercy  
Christ, have mercy  
Lord, have mercy on me  
(x2)
