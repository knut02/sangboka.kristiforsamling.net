We shall overcome  
We shall overcome  
We shall overcome, some day

Oh, deep in my heart  
I do believe  
We shall overcome, some day

We'll walk hand in hand  
We'll walk hand in hand  
We'll walk hand in hand, some day

Oh, deep in my heart  
I do believe  
We shall overcome, some day

We shall live in peace  
We shall live in peace  
We shall live in peace, some day

Oh, deep in my heart  
I do believe  
We shall overcome, some day

We are not afraid  
We are not afraid  
We are not afraid, TODAY

Oh, deep in my heart  
I do believe  
We shall overcome, some day

The whole wide world around  
The whole wide world around  
The whole wide world around some day

Oh, deep in my heart  
I do believe  
We shall overcome, some day
