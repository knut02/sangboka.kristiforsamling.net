Glory be to Jesus,  
who in bitter pains  
poured for me the life blood  
from his sacred veins!

Grace and life eternal  
in that blood I find,  
blest be his compassion  
infinitely kind!

Abel's blood for vengeance  
pleaded to the skies;  
but the blood of Jesus  
for our pardon cries.

Oft as it is sprinkled  
on our guilty hearts,  
Satan in confusion  
terror-struck departs;

Lift ye then your voices;  
swell the mighty flood;  
louder still and louder  
praise the precious blood.
