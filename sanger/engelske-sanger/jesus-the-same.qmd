I never expected  
that the things I did  
-- I wish were undone --  
could be seen so clear by someone  
before the friendship began

A dream for my future  
I've never had before  
came in to my mind  
I said to him: "Please save my journey  
and let this venture begin"

**Chorus :**  
Yesterday is gone  
Today is a new song  
Tomorrow is forever, with Jesus,  
Jesus the sameÂ  :/ 

" Today" was his promise,  
" You will be with me  
and follow me home"  
" There's no priest, no man between us,  
I have the key to the door"  
The hope that I carry  
that He gave to me,  
is clear in my mind

" You will be with me in heaven,  
forever you will be mine"
