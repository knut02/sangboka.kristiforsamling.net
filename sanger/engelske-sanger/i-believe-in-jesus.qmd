I believe in Jesus  
I believe He is the Son of God  
I believe He died and rose again  
I believe He paid for us all

And I believe He is here now  
Standing in our midst  
Here With the power to heal now  
And the grace to forgive

I believe in You, Lord  
I believe You are the Son of God  
I believe You died and rose again  
I believe You paid for us all.

And I believe You're here now  
Standing in our midst  
Here With the power to heal now  
And the grace to forgive
