Rise up, O men of God!  
Have done with lesser things.  
Give heart and mind and soul and strength  
to serve the King of kings.

Rise up, O men of God!  
The kingdom tarries long.  
Bring in the day of brotherhood  
and end the night of wrong. 

Rise up, O men of God!  
The church for you doth wait,  
her strength unequal to her task;  
rise up, and make her great!

Lift high the cross of Christ!  
Tread where his feet have trod.  
As brothers of the Son of Man,  
rise up, O men of God!
