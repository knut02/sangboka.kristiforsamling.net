I love You, Lord  
For Your mercy never fails me  
All my days, I've been held in Your hands  
From the moment that I wake up  
Until I lay my head  
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

And all my life You have been faithful  
And all my life You have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

I love Your voice  
You have led me through the fire  
In the darkest night  
You are close like no other  
I've known You as a Father  
I've known You as a Friend  
And I have lived in the goodness of God

And all my life You have been faithful  
And all my life You have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

Your goodness is running after  
It's running after me  
Your goodness is running after  
It's running after me  
With my life laid down  
I'm surrendered now  
I give You everything  
'Cause Your goodness is running after  
It's running after me (oh-oh)

'Cause Your goodness is running after  
It's running after me  
Your goodness is running after  
It's running after me  
With my life laid down  
I'm surrendered now  
I give You everything  
'Cause Your goodness is running after  
It keeps running after me

And all my life You have been faithful  
And all my life You have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God  
(I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna sing)

'Cause all my life You have been faithful  
And all my life You have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God  
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
