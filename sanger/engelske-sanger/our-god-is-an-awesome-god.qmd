Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
with wisdom and power and love  
Our God is an awesome God
(X2)

He delivered his people  
from the Egypt's land  
And he sent them out  
into the desertÂ  sand  
But after a while  
came the big Red Sea,  
Now, he did all this just to  
set them free

He delivered his people  
over all the earth  
And he's chosen us  
to be his precious church  
Now after a while  
we will see him come  
and he'll let his children  
see the risen one.
