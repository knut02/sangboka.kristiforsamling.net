Father, into your courts I will enter,  
maker of heaven and earth,  
I tremble in your holy presence  
Glory, glory in your sanctuary,  
splendour and majesty, Lord,  
before you; all life adores you

All the earth will declare  
that your love is ev'rywhere  
The fields will exalt, seas resound  
Hear the trees' joyful cry,  
praising you and so will I  
A new song I'll sing, Lord,  
I will glorify and bless your holy name

Jesus, Lord of all life and salvation,  
into your presence we come,  
we worship you, our precious saviour  
Fill us, fill us with your holy power,  
set us aflame with your love,  
till nations all know your glory

All the earth will declare  
that your love is ev'rywhere  
The fields will exalt, seas resound  
Hear the trees' joyful cry,  
praising you and so will I  
A new song I'll sing, Lord,  
I will glorify and bless your holy name
