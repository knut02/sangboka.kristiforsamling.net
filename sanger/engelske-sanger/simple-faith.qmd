Elisha was a special man  
a farmer handling several cows  
then Elia threw his coat on him

Now God was calling him to leave  
his comfort zone and trust in him  
Elisha killed his cows and made a feast

**Chorus:**  
Simple faith, simple trust,  
simply love like he did on the earth  
You will live, you'll be strong  
you will see his words come true :/ 

He said good buy to mom and dad  
They might have thought it's very sad  
Elisha knew his God was in control

The journey started off they went  
I don't think they brought any tent  
They knew their God was in total control
