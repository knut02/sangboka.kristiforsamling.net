If life is just a song I will sing it for you  
If life is just a path I will walk it for you

Jesus, Jesus, Lord of all! :/ 

Down upon the earth to set me free  
to break the chains that had a hold on me

Jesus, Jesus, Lord of all! :/ 

Always by my side to comfort me  
Always by my side to carry me

Jesus, Jesus, Lord of all! :/ 

The world that we know will pass away  
The life that you give will forever stay
