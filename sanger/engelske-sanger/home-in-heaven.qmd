I've got a home, I've got a crown  
I've got a love, won't let me down  
I've got a home, I've got a prize  
He'll wipe away, tears from my eyes

**Chorus:**  
In heaven, in heaven  
I've got a home in heaven

I've got a home, forever to stay  
I've been forgiven, I'm on my way  
I've got a home, I've got his grace  
I'll see my Lord, face to face

**Chorus:**  
In heaven, in heaven  
I've got a home in heaven

I've got a home, though I once was lost  
Jesus, he found me, his blood on the cross  
I've got a home, I get to share  
I've got a promise, I'll see you there

**Chorus:**  
In heaven, in heaven  
I've got a home in heaven
