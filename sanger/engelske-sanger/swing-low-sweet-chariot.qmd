**Chorus:**  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home!  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan and what did I see?  
Coming for to carry me home!  
A band of angels comin' after me  
Coming for to carry me home!

If you get to heaven before I do  
Coming for to carry me home!  
Tell all my friends I'm coming too  
Coming for to carry me home!

I'm sometimes up sometimes down  
Coming for to carry me home!  
But still my soul feels heavenly bound  
Coming for to carry me home!
